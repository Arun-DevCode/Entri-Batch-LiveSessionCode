      Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
      civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was
      known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of
      ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal
      organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II nuclear tests
      in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in 1974. <br />

      Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of
      both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian
      National Congress. He was widely referred to as the "People's President".
      He engaged in teaching, writing and public service after his presidency.
      He was a recipient of several awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's
      highest civilian honour. <br />
      <br />
      While delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
      an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands attended
      the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was
      buried with full state honours. A memorial was inaugurated near his home
      town in 2017.
